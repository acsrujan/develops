# devMLOps
Sandwiching ML in DevOps pipelines. This is a self learning repo for myself and will focus on how to deal with ML Ops and fit them in DevOps CI/CD, Testing suites, Notebooks, etc.

#### What is ML Ops? And why is it different from DevOps?

While DevOps focuses on shipping code from development to production in a streamlined process while taking care of not breaking the system in any of the million ways, MLOps focuses on helping engineers write, train and test their ML code and deploy it to production while taking care of data bundling, test cases, etc.

In few ways, they're similar. They aren't to be thought of as independent circles but a continuously shifting intersection of them.

The challenges of MLOps too, are quite different from DevOps.

#### What all should I learn?
